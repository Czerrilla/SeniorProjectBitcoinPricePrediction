# SeniorProjectBitcoinPricePrediction
This is my senior project for Computer Science at Roanoke College 2022.<br>
<br>
This project is designed to Improve the results of previous work done for Bitcoin Price Prediction. The machine learning
algorithm used is Random Forest. More Information about this project can be found within BitcoinPricePredictionUsingRandomForest.pdf. If any questions arise about the code, data, or results contact Cameron - cgzerrilla@gmail.com.<br>

Files<br>
1.BitcoinPricePredictionUsingRandomForest.pdf- final report for the project<br>
//Data Files <br>
<br>
2.BitcoinandNasdaq.csv - holds the Bitcoin and Nasdaq data<br>
3.BitcoinandEthereumdata.csv - holds the Bitcoin and Ethereum data<br>
4.Bitcoindata.csv - holds only the bitcoin data<br>
<br>
//Result Files<br>
Each of the files containts the results for each set of trees for instance column RMSE 8020 of file BitcoinNasdaqRowResults row 35 represents the RMSE results for an 80 20 training test split for a set of 34 trees each column has a title so the row number -1 is the number of trees used in the set.<br>
